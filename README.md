I've used this a fair bit in a few of my projects. Decided that I probably should pull it out and make it it's own thing.

Takes in a string, dices it up and compares it to another set of strings stored in an array.

Pretty easy to use just call the function and supply the string as the first argument and an array with strings as the second.
